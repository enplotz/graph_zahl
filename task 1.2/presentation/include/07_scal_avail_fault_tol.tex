\frametitle{Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
  \item very good scalability
         \item the goal is to create a graph database with virtually unlimited scalability
         \item it is said that infinite graph can search billions of connections and relationships in massive volumes of complex data
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What types of scalability are supported, i.e., horizontal and/or vertical?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Supports horizontal scalability
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What types of data partitioning are supported, i.e., horizontal (sharding) and/or vertical?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Autonomous partition structure	
	\item Autonomous partitions are independent from network and system failures
	\item each has own lock server and a complete architecture
	\item each contains references to other partitions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What types of data replication are supported, i.e., synchronous and/or asynchronous?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Synchronous data replication
	\item If one database image is updated, a min number of other replicas are updated also
	\item min number of images represents consistent view of he database
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How is scalability achieved?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item distributed data tier supports parallel IO
	\item distributed cash/processor tier
         \item quorum protocol
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How is fault tolerance achieved?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Objectivity/DB Fault Tolerant Option
\item services are distributed and relocated so that each partition is self-sufficient in case of  failure in other partitions
	
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 
\begin{frame}

\frametitle{How is availability achieved?}
\begin{itemize}
\item strive for high availability 
\item reads requested information from closest copy
\item	multiple network or machine failures possible before databases become unavailable
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
