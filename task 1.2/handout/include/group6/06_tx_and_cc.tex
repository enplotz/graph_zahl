InfiniteGraph supports two transaction models,
\emph{Standard Ingest}which offers full ACID transactions and
\emph{Accelerated Ingest} which implements some kind of eventual consistency.
Ingest means loading data into the database.

\subsubsection{Standard Ingest}

Standard Ingest offers full ACID transactions, thus can be classified as CP respective PC/EC.
Page-level read/write locks are used for concurrency control, but no further details are given.
After committing, the graph is immediately consistent.

\subsubsection{Advanced Ingest}

Few information is given on the actual implementation.
While some hints could be derived from Objectity DB (which is used for persisting the graph),
it is harmful to do so due to lack on details on the mapping between InfiniteGraph and Objectivity DB.

Advanced Ingest offers some kind of eventual consistency that is not further explained.
No definite information on CAP respective PAC/ELC is given;
but P?/EL can be derived from the fact consistency is eventual.

Transactions are supported for rollback, but no information is given on conflict resolution.
